How do I renew my Power engineer certificate?,"To renew your Power Engineer certificate, you can process your renewal through the online services of Technical Safety BC. If you already have a Power Engineer account, you can directly proceed with the renewal. If you don't have an account, you need to register for an Online Services account to access your latest certification information.

Your Power Engineer certificate is valid for three years after the date of issue. You can renew online with Technical Safety BC up to one year prior to your certificate�s expiry date. Renewing early does not reduce the time of your certificate being in an 'active' status.

If you hold multiple certificates with independent scopes, you must renew each certificate before its expiry date. For example, if you hold a Fifth Class Power Engineer certificate and a Refrigeration Operator certificate, you must renew both certificates because their scope of work is independent from one another. However, if you hold a Fourth Class Power Engineer certificate and a Refrigeration Operator certificate, only the Fourth Class Power Engineer certificate needs to be renewed, because the scope of the Refrigeration Operator certificate is covered by your Fourth Class Power Engineer certificate.

Please note that if you do not renew your certificate but continue to perform regulated work, you put yourself and others at risk. A safety officer may issue a compliance order, or recommend a monetary penalty. A safety officer may be authorized to stop your work in the field. You will also need to re-apply for your certificate if you want to be able to legally work as a power engineer again.",Certification,BPVR
