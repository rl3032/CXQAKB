1,Do I require a silver label?,"Used manufactured homes (whether de-registered with the BC Manufactured Home Registry or not) may only be offered for sale in BC when they bear an approval label.
A new approval label is required where wiring of a used manufactured home has been completely removed and new wiring has been installed under a permit.
Alterations, including additional wiring to an approved unit must be done under a permit and a new approval label is not required.
When a manufactured home has had additions or outbuildings installed and wired without an electrical installation permit, an electrical contractor must obtain an installation permit, survey the work and submit a declaration confirming that the electrical installation is adequate for the purpose and in good order, in accordance with rule 2-300.
Alternate documentation, such as a letter from the manufacturer indicating that the unit was originally approved, cannot be accepted in place of an approval label. However, if original documentation exists (for example, a specification sheet with CSA number) and there have been no unpermitted alterations to the unit, a silver label may be applied by a safety officer upon notification of an inspection request under a silver label permit and confirmation that the installation is in good order in accordance with rule 2-300. A Used Mobile Home Inspection Report is not required under these circumstances.",5/10/2024,https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/regulatory-resources/regulatory-notices/information-bulletin-approval-manufactured-homes-and-factory-built-structures,3/31/2015,Electrical,Regulatory Resources,Regulatory Notices,,,
2,How to get silver safety approval?,"For Technical Safety BC silver label approval, where no evidence of current or previous approval is provided, a licensed electrical contractor must:
